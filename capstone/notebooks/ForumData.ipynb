      "As soon as I feel hungry, a muscle/nerve/something from mid-chest to lower jaw starts paining. If I pop a quarter spoon of sugar, the pain vanishes, only till the sugar is consumed. Sometimes my digestion is sluggish and whatever I eat lasts long till next meal time. Invariably, dinner time is the most problematic. If I sleep within 2 hours of dinner, I do get good sleep BUT BS rises too much. If I wait for 2 hours, many a time I feel hungry again and cannot sleep one bit. Then I pop some sugary liquid, which helps me sleep but ... fasting sugar rises too much. Has anyone faced such problem?\n",

      "(The problem above is one of the many I am facing and perplexed, hence asking one by one. My Fasting sugar is not reducing from around 250. I have varicose veins and due to high BS, wounds are not healing in my leg-fingers and ankle. Earlier I took Triglynase 1, 500mg twice plus Zetamet Plus 1000, once at night (all 30 min before food) for a couple of years and BS, usually fluctuated around 135-150. Now the MD has prescribed Gluconorm G2 Forte, twice with food and Istavel, 100 mg once, with food. Its almost 3 days with no change in fasting BS.)Sounds like you need to see doctors.Any specific you recommend? I am confused, whom to approachEating sugar or sugary liquids is likely not good for blood glucose. \n",

Carbs and fat are the two macronutrients for energy; protein will provide some, but it's inefficient in that regard. Maybe you should calculate the three macronutrients in your diet for a week or so, to see where you can replace some of the protein with (preferably) good saturated fats. And maybe also replace some of the carbs with good fats, to keep the energy up for the whole day. I'm 75 and walk/jog at least 6km a day, often up to 12, and my energy lasts me the whole day.\n",

This was before my diagnosis and I'm sure my blood sugar was really high.\n",

Have you asked your doctor to try an alternative med to see if that's the culprit?Other thought is to look at what you're eating in the evening. Your morning elevated BG is an indication that perhaps you had too many carbs the night before.\n",

      "Hi, everyone. I went to the endocrinologist today for the first time. I've been Type II for a long time (over 20 years) and I've always struggled with weight and keeping my blood sugar in check. I only have about 40 lbs. to lose, but it's been tough. I used to be on Metformin, then they upped the dose. Then they added Glipizide. The problem is that if I try to eat healthy or low carb, the Glipizide makes my blood sugar go too low, fast. I tried getting rid of the Metformin, but my blood sugar stayed too high. We cut the Glipizide in half, and it still makes my blood sugar go too low, too fast. I ended up eating too many carbs or too much food to compensate for the lows, which makes it hard to lose weight or keep my blood sugar regular. My a1c is not too high, but I think it's not too accurate, either, since the A1c is an average and my bs goes up and down a lot. So my doctor sent me to this endo guy, to the city, which is 2 1/2 hours from our town.  He wants me to try Steglatro. Has anyone tried this?  It has some scary side effects. It can give you a yeast infection, urinary tract infection, dehydration and worse. Has anyone tried it and/or had problems with it?\n",

      "\t\t\tHi, everyone. I went to the endocrinologist today for the first time. I've been Type II for a long time (over 20 years) and I've always struggled with weight and keeping my blood sugar in check. I only have about 40 lbs. to lose, but it's been tough. I used to be on Metformin, then they upped the dose. Then they added Glipizide. The problem is that if I try to eat healthy or low carb, the Glipizide makes my blood sugar go too low, fast. I tried getting rid of the Metformin, but my blood sugar stayed too high. We cut the Glipizide in half, and it still makes my blood sugar go too low, too fast. I ended up eating too many carbs or too much food to compensate for the lows, which makes it hard to lose weight or keep my blood sugar regular. My a1c is not too high, but I think it's not too accurate, either, since the A1c is an average and my bs goes up and down a lot. So my doctor sent me to this endo guy, to the city, which is 2 1/2 hours from our town.  He wants me to try Steglatro. Has anyone tried this?  It has some scary side effects.

He does not want me taking much sulfonylureas because they tend to cause weight gain.  He says insulin also causes weight gain and wants me to stay off of it as long as possible. He prescribes Glimeperide for the times my bg goes too high, and yes it is notorious for causing lows, but I only take it in small doses so have only had a couple lows after exercise. I now takb both Ozempic and Januvia. I have been on Vicotza, then Ozempic when my insurance started covering it and and going to switch to Trulicity if it causes less GI side effects for me. I like the GLP-1's which don't cuase weight gain.  They have not helped \"me\" lose, though. They also protect the cardiovascular system.   my endo loves them. My endo reads all the time and sounds like an encyclopedia when he talks about the meds and their pros and cons, so I have every confidence in his wisdom.  My best to  you. Keep us posted.\n",

I had a bad 24 hours after apparently eating something my body did not like [or maybe food had nothing to do with it??]. So today I am only eating what sounds okay.  not much  Still waiting to hear from the doctor about biopsy results.  I probably need to check the patient portal. I may have a message.\n",

I think it's good for awareness, but don't let it scare you or stress you.I saw my PCP yesterday, 9 weeks after switching from Victoza to Ozempic.

Even if your BG is OK, the more carbs you eat, the more glucose you have, and the more insulin is required to metabolize that glucose. As cells become resistant to high levels of insulin, they stop responding to it, so to reduce the excess glucose, it is converted to fat and stored in the body. \n",

Lettuce with vinegar and oil dressing was it....and the motivation and willpower to overcome the obstacles most people will experience to actually get on the diet.

It seemed to me at diagnosis that the best way to keep diabetic complications at bay was to aim for non-diabetic numbers at all times, so that's what I've done, and I test fasting every day to keep track of how I am doing plus ensure I have my HbA1c tested every quarter to make sure I am maintaining good control.

If your levels are between 5.7 to 6.4 percent, you may be prediabetic. A level of 6.5 percent or higher indicates diabetes.\n",

      "Therefore, you should probably try to keep your A1c at less than 6.5%. Many people on this forum feel that lower is safer so they choose to keep their A1c below 6%. One aspect to diabetes is the longer your A1c is elevated, the more risk you have of developing diabetic complications like blindness and kidney damage later in life. In most cases, we're talking about people whose A1c is > 8% or 9% for 10 or 15 years. However, if you are young (like under 50) you would be wise to keep your A1c on the low side. But if you are older (like over 70) you can probably get by with higher numbers.What shows on the lab report is the normal range. Your goal as a diabetic can be whatever you want, or what you and your doctor think is best. My goal is to keep my A1c as close to normal range as possible.\n",

      "Personally, as someone with T2 (and no meds), my own goal has always been under 6. Often it's been quite a bit lower (in the 4% range a few times), sometimes it's been on the higher end of the 5% range, and the past few years it's been 6.0-6.3 -- I'm okay with that.\n",
      "It might help to remember that what you're doing is setting a target or goal -- this does not mean you will always meet it or that not meeting it means you're doing something wrong, or anything like that. Our bodies are strange and wonderful things, and we can't have complete control of them 100% of the time.\n",

      "There are other things you can do besides cut carbs that could influence your BG/A1c numbers and your weight. For example, exercising regularly can help with BG, and if you include some (more?) workouts with weights, you'll not only help your BG but you could also build some (more?) muscle, which might help you gain or at least maintain your weight. Someone mentioned adding more protein and/or fat to your diet; adding (more?) non-starchy veggies might also be helpful. If you like milk and you're okay with drinking whole milk, you can get a good combo right there -- some carbs but also fat and protein. Things like getting enough sleep and managing stress can also help.\n",
      "I don't know about the timing of your meals, but for me, it's always been helpful to eat a meal every 4-6 hours and to keep a fairly consistent schedule from day to day.\n",
      "Maybe this would also be helpful for you? I often have a snack of 1/4 cup nuts 1-2 times per day -- they're a tasty and filling way to add some protein and fat to your diet (without many carbs). If I wanted to gain weight, I might very well have more than 1/4 cup at one time.\n",

And I think that 100% comes from the upbringing I had: there was a whole lot of denial of pleasures of any sort, and very little, if any, \"yes\" responses to requests I made for anything.

I think most have mentioned testing after meals, but you can also test first thing in the morning, before you eat/do anything and compare the number you see to the 190 fasting test you got from the doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll see whether (or how) the changes you are making (whatever they may be) are affecting your BG levels by using a meter. Keep in mind that BG does go up and down all the time over the course of a day (esp for people who are newly diagnosed), so it's not like the 190 you got from the doctor's lab is \"your\" number or anything like that. You're likely to see quite a wide variation in numbers when you start testing with a meter, esp if you're testing fasting and after meals/snacks, after exercise, etc.\n",

      ">If you don't have insurance or just don't want to deal with calling the doctor and having to buy a specific brand, you can buy a meter yourself for not much money. Most pharmacies sell them, as do places like Target, Walmart, etc (in their pharmacy sections). You can look around online to see what's available (it can be a bit overwhelming, IMHO) or you can just walk into whatever pharmacy/store you prefer and see them in person. Sometimes they're kept behind the counter and you have to ask the pharmacist to see the meters, and sometimes they're out on a shelf and you can look at them without asking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meter: Usually you can get a store or sort-of generic brand for about $30 or so. There are lots of different brands, with lots of different bells and whistles, but there's no need to buy the fanciest or most expensive. The basics of how they work are the same, and most have pretty accurate results.\n",
      "Strips: You'll also need to buy test strips that \"go with\" or \"match\" the meter -- prices vary, but the ones I get cost about $8 for 50 strips. You'll use a strip every time you test. \n",
      "A lancing device and lancets: These must match each other but they don't need to match the meter. Usually when you buy a lancing device, a few lancets (5?) are included. Instructions normally say you must change the lancet every time you test, but this is not true; often you can go a year or longer without changing the lancet. The lancing device and lancets are also fairly cheap.\n",

      "sugar is sugar.  processed means nothingI think it would be very helpful to yourself to stop using the word \"sugar\" when referring to how much of what you should eat. There are only 3 types of macromolecules in the world: proteins, fats and carbohydrates. During digestion, proteins break down into amino acids and get absorbed into the blood stream. Fats break down into fatty acids and carbohydrates break down into sugars (primarily glucose).  So when you ask if eliminating sugar (like table sugar, fruit juices, bakery products, etc) will effect your bg, that makes no sense. ANY and ALL carbohydrates you ingest will enter your bloodstream as some type of sugar, get converted to glucose and effect your diabetes. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you read the posts here on DD, you will see that the best way to bring your diabetes under control is to \"eat to your meter\". In other words, test your bg immediately before a meal, record the number of carbs in the meal, then test yourself again two hours after the meal. Do this for different meals on different days until you begin to understand how many carbs your body can handle while keeping your bg where you want it (usually 80-140 mg/dl). Just limiting the amount of \"sugar\" that you eat in coffee, soda, juice, etc will do you no good.  \n",

      "Diabetes, type 2: One of the two major types of diabetes, the type in which the beta cells of the pancreas produce insulin but the body is unable to use it effectively because the cells of the body are resistant to the action of insulin. Although this type of diabetes may not carry the same risk of death from ketoacidosis, it otherwise involves many of the same risks of complications as does type 1 diabetes (in which there is a lack of insulin).\n",
      "The aim of treatment is to normalize the blood glucose in an attempt to prevent or minimize complications. People with type 2 diabetes may experience marked hyperglycemia, but many do not require insulin injections and can be treated with diet, exercise, and oral hypoglycemic agents (drugs taken by mouth to lower the blood sugar).\n",
      "Type 2 diabetes requires good dietary control including the restriction of calories, lowered consumption of simple carbohydrates and fat with increased consumption of complex carbohydrates and fiber. Regular aerobic exercise is also an important method for treating both type 2 diabetes since it decreases insulin resistance and helps burn excessive glucose. Regular exercise also may help lower blood lipids and reduce some effects of stress, both important factors in treating diabetes and preventing complications.\n",
      "Type 2 diabetes is also known as insulin-resistant diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes, and adult-onset diabetes.\n",

I test 14 or more times a day now and know exactly where I am and what to do/eat etc and just what I have done right or wrong! I really advize you to enlighten your good self with a product such as this! It certainly has helped me! At £45 a sensor it makes one cough a bit though! It can be obtained on our National Health though I am told but knowing my luck!!? Anyway I can stretch to it if my health is dependent on it! It is only money if one has a bit of it! My/Our Health comes first! Most of all and it is so easy to say! Do not Worry! Take heed of Good Professional Advice and listen to and trust your inner self! I can tell by reading your post that you are a good and sound person and are justly upset by experiencing your quite unpleasant condition and symptoms! That can \"Throw\" You or anyone else a bit sideways! I do hope that you will soon go \"Into Remission\", which is our main aim in life for now! Pity us Pulease! Better things will follow though! You bet! One step at a time! Take heart that you have achieved quite \"Normal\" readings! I trust the \"Average” Reading 8 or something like that for me will do!

You should feel at your best when things are in optimum range; however, the body can do a lot in the way of compensating to make us feel somewhat normal when we're not and that can happen with diabetes.

      "I can't explain it in scientific terms, but I know it happens in many different ways (not just re: BG and diabetes). Like you might, without realizing it, start walking a little differently because you hurt your knee or your foot -- not enough to put it out of commission, but enough that your body knows it can't step or walk the same way it usually does. Once the hurt knee or foot is back to being okay, you might feel a little pain or discomfort in the other knee or foot because it had been compensating for the one that was hurt. Does that make sense re: BG?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One way to think about it is, things that you do consciously. This may sound like a silly example, but last year I broke my right arm near my shoulder. I am right-handed (nowhere close to ambidextrous). For quite a while, I brushed my teeth with my left hand (try that sometime -- not fun, but it can be done). That's just one instance of the many things I had to do without using my right hand/arm; everything from getting dressed to getting a bowl of water on the floor for my dog, and much more, I had to do with my non-dominant hand/arm. For quite a few weeks, my broken right arm was essentially glued to the side of my body; I did not take the sling off, did not change out of the hospital gown I was given at the minor emergency center the day I broke my arm, etc. Not the end of the world, but they were major adjustments I consciously made because my body wasn't working the way it normally does.\n",
      "\n",
      "When my arm started healing (and PT helped a lot!), everything did not become okay overnight. I had adjusted my way of doing things and somehow did okay -- but I still had pain and had difficulty doing some things.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm probably thinking of this because exactly a year ago today, August 23, 2022, is when I broke my arm. The doctor and the PT both said to expect to take a full year for a full recovery -- and the past few weeks I've been testing myself to see not just \"can I do this?\" but \"can I do this easily and can I do it the same way I used to? Can I stretch this far just as easily and without any pops or limitations or tightness when compared to how I can stretch with my left arm?\" So far, the answers are YES!  \n",
      "\n",
      "So I think that when your body \"gets used to\" high BG, it's kind of like when doing things with my left hand/arm became easier. And doing the PT was kind of like doing what's needed to get BG lower, into the non-diabetic range or close to it. But the body's adjustment isn't a conscious process (like my PT was). Maybe not quite a perfect comparison -- and certainly not a scientific explanation! \n",

If you aren't sure if he's low, a small amount of electrolyte drink (with sugar) might be all he needs to feel better. But he could best advise you on this.I agree that a few ounces of Gatorade or similar would be appropriate. I also agree that he would be the best to advise you. However, if you are reluctant to give fluids to an unconscious person, what do you do in the case of heat stroke or dehydration?I wonder if the company has a first aid kit, could a glucometer be added to the supplies to check a sugar. Also, glucose gel is another option that is less likely to cause problems in a semi conscious person. Otherwise glucagon (which I believe comes in a nasal formulation as well now). I would check with him (if he is willing - I don’t know about the legality if he is not willing to disclose) about what meds he is on as far as risk of lows.

      "For treatment of suspected low blood sugar: when I worked at summer camp we used corn syrup. It can also be applied to the gums. Gels used by endurance athletes work too - you need to make sure they have enough sugar in them. But if someone was unconscious the camp medical staff would bring glucagon and then they would be moved to the medical cabin and given IV. Glucagon would be your best bet if you know someone who has diabetes and that they are having low blood sugar. There is a nasal spray called Baqsimi . This has to be prescribed to that employee by their doc though. As well as using a Continuous Glucose Monitor (this person would know what their blood glucose is and could intercept a low before it happens) but this would be up to the person going through their doctor to get one. \n",

      "Hi! So, today I left the house for work at around 9:30 or so and I came home about 1.5 hours ago. Turns out that in my rush this morning, I left my insulin lispro pens outside of the fridge. I left them out for a good 8 hours on my table in the living room (give or take). I put them back in the fridge right after I got home. The table I put them on usually but not always gets sunlight and I know the sun can be bad for the insulin. However, the AC in my house was set at 71. Any recommendations on what I should in this case? I got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes almost a month ago and I’m super overwhelmed between the diabetes and work and life….I have never used Lispro. However, I have used Lantus. The Lantus instructions said to leave the current pen at room temperature and keep extra pens in the refrigerator. Based on that, I assume your Lispro is fine. You might check with your pharmacist to be sure.@skessdtrek just posted a helpful research report about insulin storage temperatures.

Luckily she and her family are terrific and  it went well. I have another friend who found a half sibling and it did not go well. Including when they met, the half sib had someone rob their house. And finally I have  friend who is an NPE (not parent expected). She found out her dad (who is now long since passed as is her Mom) is not her biological father. She has been devastated and apparently this is common enough that there are support groups all over the place. Luckily, she has one half sib who she gets along with (apparently that family is just as shocked and many do not want to meet my friend).

Unfortunately, while I am still experimenting with adding foods to my diet and what they might do, there is a strong chance I might spike to over 200 ince in while (hopefully not, though).

      "My doc told me that a T1 diagnosis would have a c-Peptide of .2 or lower. I think he said my .79 (\"normal\" range started at .8 on the lab report) was to be expected, which makes me feel he isn't too versed with T2 diabetic treatment, since many T2s can have high insulin levels, but are just insulin resistant. Not all have lower insulin levels to be \"expected\". So their bodies actually make more insulin to compensate for the rising BG levels due to the resistance and once the resistance is lowered by diet or exercise, their numbers are easier to manage. My suspicion is that is something that happens earlier on in our disease and later on in the progression the pancreas gets tired and worn and then stops producing as much insulin anymore (I might be dealing with both, unfortunately, due to not catching my condition earlier on. Ugh, I can just kick myself for ignoring the symptoms I had for so long) I am wondering if that is what happened to me. But, I have seen the normal c-Peptide level starting at .5 and not .8 (per a Google search), as well as I was fasting when the test was done. Which makes me wonder what the results would have been if it had been done later in the day or after a meal. Maybe I do still produce \"normal\" insulin, but just am at the lower end of the spectrum.\n",

      "Once when I went for a first visit to a new doctor, who checked me in (and weighed me, took my BP, etc) but a former student of mine! I was so nervous -- I mean, really, a former student is going to have all this personal info on me...and might even see me naked? Yikes. Though I've never had a problem with high BP under \"normal\" circumstances, my BP was high this time. I wonder why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so funny:\n",
      "The doctor was concerned about my BP results, so I explained the situation and he said the former-student-thing shouldn't matter. Yeah, right. He agreed to \"let me\" check my BP on my own over the next few weeks and then report back to him rather than immediately prescribe meds. When I came back to him with my numbers, he saw they were okay. They were also okay that day when my former student's expected appearance didn't surprise me; but the doctor insisted on checking my BP himself, just to make sure -- the results were better than a few minutes earlier when my former student had done the test. The doctor then lectured me about the importance of taking care of high BP early, and mentioned that my father had died of a heart attack at age 48. I told him, no, actually my father had died of a heart attack at age 58 (after grueling cancer treatments), and he said, \"No, my father died of a heart attack at age 48.\" So he wanted to treat me based on his own family history...and in spite of the fact that multiple tests showed I did not have high BP?  I did not keep going to this doctor for very long.\n",

As much as I'm thrilled with Ozempic, I told my Endo point blank that I wouldn't have wanted to try it without a cgm.  Even with my cgm and closed-loop pump, the first week was a bit nasty.  It's just a pretty dramatic impact on insulin sensitivity when it kicks in.  I had at least one trip into the 50's.  But as my pump adjusted, it got better quickly.

      "Hey guys it's Emily I'm diagnosed with type 2 diabetes I'm on metformin two 500 mg extended release form. I have migraines and been having a 14 day stretch of non stop migraine minus last Thursday because on Wednesday I threw up twice from my migraine and I had to go home early from work that day. I finally got in touch with my neurologist who decided to put me on a dose of Prednisone step down taper 4mg for about a week. I know that steroids can raise your blood sugar but is there anything else I should look for regarding the Prednisone? And I've noticed that my blood sugar level is going up and up instead of going down It has been some time, but I developed weight gain and puffy face/jowl when I was prescribed (years 20  ago). I'm sure others will have some more current responses.Okay thanks for answering so quickly.Fatigue, dizziness, weight gain, puffy face, elevated blood sugar.When I hd prednisone My BG went to 295 and sat there....  I took 3 times my normal insulin and it came down to 280.\n",

Ask your doc for one that's not a steroid.There's \"raises your BG a little\" and \"shoots it to the moon\". Prednisone has reputation for the latter as well as the former. It's probably not a great long term treatment if you have a different option that doesn't have that particular side effect.Well, I don't recall it making mine shoot to the moon, though it certainly did go up more than just a little. I've had to use it a couple of times, short term. Not sure if it was a bad case of bronchitis or pneumonia, but I did prioritize breathing well over good blood sugars. I wouldn't want it to for long-term use.\n",

It just means that at the moment that blood sample was taken, your endogenous insulin was at the low end of normal. As I recall, you are taking metformin which is supposed to make your tissues more insulin sensitive.

There was no way to turn off or adjust the “low blood sugar alarm,” either. What the CGM was seeing was that my blood sugar was dropping (it was very good at recognizing trends) and then setting off its alarm. The literature accompanying these things tells you that they recognize trends but don’t really give you a precise reading of your actual blood glucose. I certainly found this to be true.

I don't see the point of starving myself to get to a certain number on my meter. Yes, staying low is important but all the stress around having to stay below a certain number (to me) just isn't worth it. If you test and you think you're a little high, have something without a lot of carbs. If you test and you're at (or below) your target number eat whatever you want.My biggest motivation for keeping my numbers as low as I can manage (and not overwork my pancreas) is so that I don't advance to a diagnosis of diabetes.

      "  People might confuse  lower blood sugar with depression as you feel  out of it.  I always suggest if one feels that way to test  and see but also if one was high and drops that can feel very wicked and make you feel strange.I was on Victoria for about 2 months.  I was very depressed but didn't associate it with the medication until I stopped the onjections.  I was happy, singing and dancing around the next day!Interesting.   Have been on it a few years now.   I love that I can eat anything.  And on the occasional day when I forget, I\"m ravenous and eat too much.    I've been depressed.  I have a history of depression, so I can't say whether it's due to Victoza.   But I'm going to think about switching to something else.\n",

      "\t\t\tI have had well-managed TII diabetes since 2003 but cannot lose weight with diet and/or exercise, therefore, the dr put me on Victoza in July, 2015.  I have been increasingly depressed in the almost 4mo I have been taking Victoza, but can find no research to indicate that is a specific side effect of the drug.  Has anyone else experienced new depression or exacerbated existing depression while taking Victoza?  Thank you.\n",
